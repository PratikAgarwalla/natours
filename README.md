## About the Project

I am Pratik Agarwalla, and I built this website as part of my learning journey in web development. This project has provided me with valuable knowledge about CSS, SASS, responsive web design, animation, and more. Full credit goes to the original instructor, Jonas Schmedtmann, for his excellent teaching and resources.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PratikAgarwalla/natours.git
cd natours

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install

```

### 3. Compile SASS and Start Development Server

To compile the SASS files and start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start

```

This will do the following:

- Watch for changes in your SASS files and compile them to CSS.
- Start a local development server using live-server.

### 4. Build the CSS

If you want to build the CSS for production, run:

```bash
npm run build-css

```

This command will:

- Compile the main SASS file.
- Concatenate the compiled CSS with other CSS files.
- Add vendor prefixes using autoprefixer.
- Compress the final CSS file.

### 5. Explore the Project

You can now open the project in your browser and explore the Natours landing page. The project showcases modern CSS techniques, animations, and responsive web design principles.
